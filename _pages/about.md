I am currently a research assistant At Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I am working in the research group of Prof. Dit-Yan. Our topic is Deep learning applications in time series. I feel interested in deep learning applications in all fields, especially with those applications related to everyday life, such as computer vision, reinforcement learning.
